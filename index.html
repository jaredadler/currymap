		<h1>Curry in Tokyo</h1>
		<p>Curry is an essential part of the Japanese diet. This was surprising to me, at first, and may also be surprising to you if you haven't spent much time in Japan. Before moving to Tokyo, I was under the impression that the most essential foods in the Japanese diet are ramen, udon, sushi, grilled meat and vegetables on skewers, miso and other light soups, and a lot of broiled and grilled fish. My impression was fairly similar to a (unscientific) look at Californians' impressions of Japanese food <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/las-idea-of-japanese-food-vs-what-japanese-really-eat-2380345" target="_blank">profiled in LA Weekly</a>. So because Japan – its culture, cuisine, and even its language – is probably the most familiar and favored part of East Asia to outside observers, it came as a surprise to discover that <b>there are over 4,000 restaurants serving curry in Tokyo</b>, two for every three <a href="http://bit.ly/1j6Tc0L" target="_blank">ramen houses</a>, while being a dish mostly unknown and unavailable outside the country.</p>

<p>Curry revealed to me this gap between what typical non-Japanese perceive Japanese cuisine to be and what it actually is, which also reminded me to not overlook a similar gap in the perception of Japanese culture abroad. This spring, I decided to learn more about curry in Japan (well, only Tokyo so far) by exploring it firsthand. Naturally, doing so has also helped me understand more about Japanese culture, and such a focus has hopefully both afforded a unique first impression of Japan and avoided a reliance on classic western stereotypes about the country and its culture.</p>

            <p>There are three parts to this story about discovering curry in Tokyo. The first is a map (seen below, and on its own <a href="htpp://kare.tokyo/map/" target="_blank">here</a>) that connects data on every restaurant from Japanese restaurant review site Tabelog with corresponding photos from these restaurants' Instagram pages and restaurant recommendations from Japanese cuisine and lifestyle magazines (as well as my own personal recommendations). The second is some background about the major types of curry that can be found in Japan, which can serve as a guide for the map and an explainer for the diversity of flavors and forms of the 4,000 curry restaurants in Tokyo. The third part is a collection of notes, in no particular order, of things I've learned about Japanese culture through the curry here (I'll keep adding to this section in the future).</p>
            
            <p style="margin: 0 0 12px" class="small"><em>(Note: If you are Japanese or have spent considerable time in Japan, this story of what I have learned about curry in Tokyo and curry's place in Japanese culture may not be interesting, but I invite you to go straight to the <a href="htpp://kare.tokyo/map/" target="_blank">map</a> I created to discover restaurants serving curry in Tokyo that you may not have tried, or to read my story and tell me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jaredadler">Twitter</a> what I missed or got wrong.)</em></p>

		<h3 style="margin: 30px 0 0">About the Map</h3>
		<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">This map displays a dot at the location of every restaurant on Tabelog categorized as serving curry, including Indian, Thai, Nepali, Pakistani, and several Japanese variations. For as many restaurants as possible, I linked up the restaurant's information from Tabelog to the location on Instagram so that recent photos are loaded when a restaurant is selected (not all of the photos are of curry). There are also top picks from Japanese food and lifestyle magazines, Tabelog reviews, and recommendations from my own experience trying curry at different restaurants in the city.</p>
		<h3>How to use the Map</h3>
		<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">If you’re in Tokyo, you can use the map to find a new curry to try near where you are or where you’re headed. The way I use it is a function of avoiding decision fatigue: either tap the “<i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i>” icon to zoom in to a current location, or tap on "<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>" and use Locate Station to see curry near a specific destination. To filter further, I hide the curry types I currently don’t want to eat and sometimes highlight top picks from magazines or online reviews to explore more popular options. Then, tapping on a dot will show the restaurant information as well as recent Instagram photos tagged at the location to see what the curry looks like, and the Google Maps link will jump to navigation.</p>
		<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">If you’re not in Tokyo (and not familiar with the city), the map could still be interesting to explore. Try zooming in on an area with a lot of dots (maybe zoom in on Jimbocho (神保町), Simokitazawa (下北沢), or Nakano (中野) stations) and click around to see recent Instagram photos from these cafes, restaurants, and bars serving curry to see what they are like. Or filter the map to display only Indian curry houses and then highlight recommended restaurants from Popeye's Tokyo Eat-Up Guide to explore Instagram photos of top-notch Indian curry all over Tokyo.</p></div>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">This is classic Japanese curry in beef, pork, or chicken varieties, served with or directly next to white rice. It is rarely spicy, but also not sweet. It sometimes is cooked with vegetables like potato and carrot, and may have a summer variation with okra, tomato, and eggplant. Curry rice is typically eaten by mixing some curry with some rice spoon-by-spoon, rather than dumping the curry directly on top of the rice. It's a hearty, heavy, unphotogenic dish, the ultimate comfort food. It seems to be enjoyed more by men than women. A curry like this tastes better when the flavor has more depth, sometimes from a longer cooking process allowing the ingredients to cook longer. Also considered part of this category are Japanese dry curries (also called keema curry), which are often served on top of rice and have a heavier meat flavor without sacrificing an unmistakable Japanese curry taste overall.</p>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Katsu kare is the classic Japanese curry with a breaded, fried pork cutlet (called tonkatsu とんかつ) on top. Tonkatsu are tasty when the fried breading is crispy and the pork inside is juicy, and they are typically served with a <a href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/homemade-tonkatsu-sauce/?_r=0" target="_blank">tonkatsu sauce</a> to cut through the grease. Although Japanese curry does not have the acidity of tonkatsu sauce, it is used in katsu kare the same way, as a dip for the pork so that the dish doesn't feel too dry. I can personally only eat this dish once in a week or two; although it can be quite tasty, it is heavy and its sheer size is enough food for the entire day.</p>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Originating in Kyushu, this is classic japanese curry placed on top of rice, often garnished with vegetables, egg, and/or cheese, then baked in a deep dish. Because the curry is ladled right on top of the rice before baking, the curry is more dry and mixed in with a crispier rice when it comes out of the oven, and each spoonful scraped out of the deep dish can grab the proper proportion of cheese, topping, curry, and rice together. Perhaps due to the time in the oven, yaki kare often seems less greasy than a regular curry rice, so although it can have heavy extra ingredients like mozarella, it isn't as heavy overall. Of all Japanese curry varieties, I think this one is my favorite.</p>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">To me, it is debatable whether European Curry deserves its own category, but some curry restaurants do actually use the term on their storefronts and menus. European Curry - at least based on those I've tried - is just a sweeter (and sometimes thicker) version of classic Japanese curry rice with an emphasis on presentation, using fancy platewear and serving curry in a stainless steel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce_boat" target="_blank">sauce boat</a>. If there are any vegetables or meat as part of a European Curry recipe, they usually will have been cooked so long that they are unrecognizable, soft lumps in the curry sauce boat. I sometimes wonder if European Curry is actually synnonymous with "Japanese curry," but is used by restauranteurs to emphasize that it is more traditional and true to its exquisite, European roots.</p>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">This is a variation of traditional Japanese curry rice that uses thick wheat flour udon noodles instead of rice. Of those I've tried, the curry is comparatively thinner in consistency, functioning as a thick soup broth for the noodles. I do not find that this type of curry dish is popular in Tokyo. The places I've seen serving it are usually udon noodle houses with a variety of soup options for the noodles including curry.</p>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Hot soup made with curry powder and filled with vegetables sounds perfect for a cold, winter day, so it makes sense that this curry variation is originally from Sapporo, one of the snowiest cities in the world. In 1971, a restaurant named <a href="http://www.magicspice.net/" target="_blank">Magic Spice</a> (who have a branch location in Tokyo <a href="http://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1318/A131802/13004603/" target="_blank">here</a>) pioneered soup curry, and originally referred to their recipe, which is <a href="http://tokyocheapo.com/food-and-drink/soup-curry-tokyo/" target="_blank">based on an indonesian soup called 'soto ayam'</a>, as a <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/recipe-sapporo-soup-curry/" target="_blank">'medicinal curry'</a> because of the spices used.</p>
                <p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Soup curry is generally not easy to find in Tokyo. Shimokitazawa, a young, 'hip' neighborhood with a wide selection of curry that hosts an annual 10-day curry festival in October, has the biggest concentration of soup curry houses in the city. My favorite in the neighborhood is called <a href="http://samurai-curry.com/" target="_blank">Rojiura Curry Samurai</a>.</p>
            <p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Most soup curry houses I've tried emphasize customization with several soup broth flavors and vegetable combinations as well as precise scales of spice level (1 to 10 or even 100). Unlike most other curry types, soup curry is best eaten by scooping up some rice with a spoon and dipping it into the curry soup.</p>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Indian curry may be more familiar to western readers of this guide than some of the aforementioned Japanese curries, but Indian curry in Japan is a bit different. Most importantly, Indian cuisine is usually served family style in western countries, where groups of two or more dine together and share a variety of dishes together. In Japan, Indian food is almost always served in individual lunch and dinner sets, similar to how most Japanese cuisine is served. And naturally, since the serving style is tailored to local preferences, flavor and spice level is sometimes adjusted to be appealing to the Japanese palate too. But the level of 'authenticity' in this regard can vary and falls into several categories:</p>
			<ul>
  <li style="margin: 12px 0 0"><b>Standard Japan-ified Indian Curry</b>: this type is probably the most common. A standard set of curries are offered - chicken or butter chicken, mutton or keema, and vegetable or 'dal' - served with all-you-can-eat nan or rice and a small Japanese-style salad on a tray. Most curry houses labeled as "Pakistani" on the above map fall into this category too. Although they follow similar formats, each restaurant has its own recipes for their curry sets and some are better than others. These are most often owned and operated by Japanese-speaking South Asian immigrants.</li>
  <li style="margin: 12px 0 0"><b>Regional Indian Curry</b>: a litle less common are restaurants that aim to offer a more unique and authentic menu of curry and other Indian cuisine, and this is usually accomplished by offering curry from a specific region of India. A few examples: <a href="http://hwsa8.gyao.ne.jp/kerala-kaze/access.html" target="_blank">Kerala No Kaze (ケララの風)</a> in Omori offers authentic Keralan lunches from the Southwestern Indian state, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PondyBhavan" target="_blank">Pondy Bhavan (ポンディバワン)</a> in Chidori-cho has a menu of curry and other Indian dishes from Tamil Nadu, and <a href="http://mandap.jp/info.html" target="_blank">MANDAP (マンダップ)</a> has a traditional Nepali Dal Bhat (ダルバート). The owners of these restaurants are usually originally from these regions. Some of the curry and other dishes these Tokyo restaurants serve would be impossible to find in even diverse cities outside South and Southeast Asia. Most Nepali restaurants, a separate category on Tabelog, tend to fall into this category.</li>
  <li style="margin: 12px 0 0"><b>Indian-themed Japanese Curry</b>: My favorite Indian curry houses are opened by Japanese chefs who emphasize South Asian flavors. These chefs sometimes have traveled in South Asia and upon return opened a restaurant offering unique personal recipes which are influenced by their experience with food or cooking classes while traveling. In addition to their unique recipes, restaurants of this sort often try to create an ambiance with Indian influence reminiscent of the 1960s hippie movement's interest in South Asian culture. While they certainly aren't authentically Indian (nor authentically Japanese), they offer an interesting and fashionable mixed-ethnicity environment where the personal inspiration of the order is evident in every aspect of their restaurant and food. One great example is <a href="http://currykusa.com/" target="_blank">Curry Kusa (curry 草枕)</a>, whose owner shares on his website that he was a backpacker and traveled throughout South Asia, the Middle East, and East Africa learning about spices used in cooking along the way. Another I can recommend is <a href="http://xn--7cka6jb.com/pc/index.html" target="_blank">Tiri Tiri (チリチリ)</a>, which has a full menu of "masala" curries served in a japanese style on a large plate next to the rice. Beyond Indian spices, <a href="http://www.marieiranganee.com/" target="_blank">Marie Iranganee (マリーアイランガニー)</a>, tucked away on a high floor of a nondescript building in Shibuya with a sitar hung on the wall and an endless playlist of Beatles songs, calls itself a "Sri Lanka Spice Cafe" and serves complex-flavored pork belly and chicken curry perhaps influenced by Sri Lankan cuisine.</li></ul>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Most Thai curry in Tokyo resembles the typical Thai curry found outside Thailand: green and red curries with a strong coconut flavor served with rice. Unlike Indian restaurants which do not promote the non-curry dishes they offer on the menu, curry at Thai restaurants is no more of a feature than other trademark Thai dishes like pad kapraw, pad thai, or tom yum goong. Of all curry types, I have the least experience with Thai curry both because the several places I've tried served food very tailored to the Japanese palate (i.e. not as spicy as Thai curry in Thailand) and also because few restaurants seem to offer any curry besides the standard options: red and green. Regional Thai curry is uncommon if not completely unavailable. If any readers have experience with Thai curry in Tokyo that exceeds in quality what I've described, please let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredadler" target="_blank">Twitter</a>!</p>
			<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Thai curry in Tokyo can also occasionally be found at western-style cafes and bars. For example, a cafe with a mixed menu of italian pasta, <a href="http://okinawa.stripes.com/news/tribute-taco-rice-us-militarys-favorite-mex-oki-fusion-food" target="_blank">taco rice</a>, and salads may also serve a Thai green curry to add to the variety. I wouldn't typically recommend having high expectations for Thai curry at such a place.</p>

				<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">There are hundreds of restaurants in Tokyo in the relatively mysterious category on Tabelog "Curry - Other. (カレー (その他))" As you might expect, this category is a catch-all for restaurants serving a type of curry that don't fall into the specific above categories. The most common type of establishment in this category is a bakery serving kare-pan (カレーパン), or curry-filled bread, a common Japanese pastry. Other than pastries, curries in this category can be quite unique. Looking at photos as well as Tabelog reviews of each one is necessary to get a sense of what they're like. For example, here are a few that I've encountered: <a href="http://www.risottocurry.com/" target="_blank">curry with risotto instead of rice</a>, <a href="http://curryfes.pw/archive/26/">Peruvian curry</a>, <a href="http://singaporeseafood.jp/" target="_blank">Singaporean curry</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SAFARI-AFRICAN-RESTAURANT-BAR-209139565797870/?ref=hl">Ethiopian curry</a>, <a href="http://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13001300/" target="_blank">Creole/Cuban "curry"</a>, <a href="http://taprobane.info/" target="_blank">Sri Lankan curry</a>, <a href="http://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1305/A130503/13149453/" target="_blank">Burmese curry</a>. If you are an adventurous eater, I highly recommend exploring this category on the map to discover unique curry recipes and curry from less internationally famous cuisines.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		<p style="margin: 12px 0 0">Curry in Japan was introduced by the British in the <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2011/08/26/food/curry-its-more-japanese-than-you-think/#.Vcs2zibXenM" target="_blank">mid-1800s</a> (who had been introduced to curry in India). In this period, Japan was in the process of opening up to and learning from the rest of the world and, like many other foreign things, treated curry as an exquisite and expensive specialty for several decades. Eventually (<a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/big-in-japan-kare-raisu-japanese-curry-rice.html" target="_blank">after World War Two</a>), large food manufacturers started mass-producing curry mixes so that the dish could be served in Japanese homes more easily and affordably. It became a quick and easy meal. It didn’t take long for curry to turn into an important Japanese comfort food where everyone’s school canteen, army mess hall, and own mother started with the same curry mixes to make their own special recipe, often a recipe that many Japanese remember fondly. Now, a Japanese eats curry <a href="http://www.sbcurry.com/qa/number_1.html" target="_blank">1.5 times per week on average</a>.</p>
		<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">When curry became a staple Japanese dish, local variations emerged. Instead of with rice, some chefs started serving curry on <a href="http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/874/Cant-get-enough-curry-udon" target="_blank">udon</a> or ramen noodles. As an alternative to the sweet, heavy pork and beef curries that first arrived from Britain, some started using seafood or local vegetables instead. Restaurants in Hokkaido began serving a <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/recipe-sapporo-soup-curry/" target="blank">soup curry</a> with “medicinal” ingredients. Kyushu chefs began adding cheese or egg and baking it to make <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/2013/01/17/better-than-ramen-kare-japans-1-food/" target="_blank"><em>Yaki kare</em></a>.</p>
		<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">By the 80s and 90s, when Japan was already a well-established wealthy, developed nation, urban Japan began spawning food trends reaching beyond what is traditional or affordable and easy to cook. Many Japanese became interested in “ethnic” or “exotic” food (i.e. cuisine other than Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, American, French, and Italian, which were already ubiquitous in Japanese cities by this time). Thai and Indian curry began gaining popularity at this time, perhaps because they both can essentially be imagined and prepared as Japanese curry rice except with spicier variations and new, exotic flavors and ingredients.</p>

			</div>
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/business/worldbusiness/24guide.html" target="_blank">New York Times reports</a> that there are 160,000 restaurants in Tokyo. Tabelog, the restaurant review site, counts 96,000 establishments in its <a href="http://tabelog.com/tokyo/rstLst/RC/" target="_blank">database</a> categorized as "restaurant." Whichever count is used, there are far more restaurants in Tokyo than there are in the big cities it is often compared with.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">A functional reason for Tokyo's large restaurant count is the city's average restaurant size. There are thousands of restaurants in the city with fewer than eight seats. In my dataset of curry restaurants used for the map, the median seat count is 24, which in a typical configuration would be six tables and a row of stools at the bar counter.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">Smaller restaurants tend to emphasize the connection between the chef and the customers. I have visited dozens of small curry restaurants that are owned and operated by a husband and wife or mother and son who most likely will cook and serve the food themselves for their entire working lives. In other countries, when a family-run restaurant becomes more popular, the owners will often expand and grow their business by moving to a larger space, hiring staff, and/or opening a second location. In contrast, these Japanese family-run restaurants do not want to lose control of their mastery of the dish they serve nor their connection with each customer who comes in the door, so they stay small.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">Japanese drinking culture also helps explain Tokyo's large number of restaurants. It is more common in Japan for friends or coworkers to choose a restaurant for both eating and drinking for the night, rather than first choosing a place for dinner and later choosing a bar for drinks. Eating and drinking are not separate activites, and Japanese taverns called "izakaya" are places that emphasize food and alcohol equally. Both the New York Times and Tabelog are surely counting this type of establishment as a "restaurant."</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">With the context of Tokyo's total count of restaurants, it actually seems like the presence of curry in Tokyo is sparse or uncommon, given that restaurants serving curry make up only 4% of all restaurants in the city. But I would not argue that the popularity of other types of restaurants indicates a lack of popularity of curry; instead, it reveals how much people in Tokyo enjoy both eating outside the home and having an expansive selection to choose from.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">It is hard to grasp what it's like to live in a city that has 96,000 restaurants to choose from, or even one with such a huge selection of one particular type of food. Here is one comparison for readers who are more familiar with New York City: consider that the <a href="http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do" target="_blank">New York Department of Health</a> counts 24,300 restaurants in the five boroughs (including delis, take-out only, any establishment with a license to serve prepared food). So to understand how much choice there is in curry in Tokyo, imagine that one out of every six restaurants in New York City throughout the five boroughs serves curry, and that is how much selection someone in Tokyo has.</p>

					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">Portion sizes in Japan are important. It is the chef's responsibility to serve a guest the exact amount of food required to nourish and fill the guest's stomach. Thus, leaving uneaten food on the plate is uncommon because (in theory) it could be considered an insult to the chef's judgement or an indication that the flavor is unsatisfactory. It is quite common to see a customer scrape their plate clean of every grain of rice and drop of curry before they are truly finished with their meal.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">For big eaters as well as someone on a diet or not particularly hungry at mealtime, it is customary in Japan to order different amounts of food rather than leaving served food uneaten. Customers can simply specify for any noodle or rice-based dish that they want a small portion (小盛) or large portion (大盛) (or even extra large 特盛) when ordering their meal. Many restaurants will also indicate on their menu how many grams of rice or noodles are contained in each size portion of their meal, and some places will charge slightly different prices for the various sizes.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">With all of this specification, it may be obvious to mention that curry in Japan is served individually. In fact, most types of restaurants in Japan either serve food in individual sets or design the menu to be suitable for an individual customer. It is common and normal to visit almost any kind of restaurant in Japan alone.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">This idea of ordering and being served "just enough" food individually like this may seem strange to people from other cultures.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">A chef or host in China's goal is to show that they can provide more than enough food as a token of their generosity (and to some extent, their wealth). So when eating at a restaurant in China, which almost always happens in a group, the host or oldest guest will deliberately order more food than could be comfortably consumed by the party, and no plate is scraped clean, as doing so may seem insulting or could lead to the host ordering another round of whatever was finished. I imagine that Chinese visiting Japan for a short time may be surprised by the difference in customs.</p>
					
					<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">Americans are used to large portions and I think typically do not place much emphasis on how much of the food they choose to eat. But in judging portions, Americans tend to assess the value of a meal, viewing favorably a restaurant that serves a large portion of food at a reasonable price. Restaurants in America are also much more generous with "filler" side dishes like french fries, chips, and dinner rolls that are often offered with unlimited refills. Thus, Americans who visit Japan often have the impression that portion sizes are much smaller both because the dish they ordered is likely objectively smaller and because the meal does not typically include a filler side to pad the stomach.</p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">Japanese magazines are different from what I'm familiar with in America.</p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">American magazines all follow a similar format reminiscent of an American sitcom or Asian TV drama: you know how long it will be, which points will be funny or interesting, which will be emotionally touching, and which will provide new information, but if you like the subject matter and connect with the characters you'll keep coming back for new episodes. Most American magazines focus on a single topic - maybe golf, Hollywood celebrities, fitness, style icons, or consumer technology - and seek customers that will trust that publication to keep them updated on that topic periodically.</p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">Japanese magazines publish issues on a much wider range of topics. As far as I can tell, major magazine brands will represent and command an audience from a certain Japanese subculture or archetype and create any kind of content that the editors would deem appealing to this type. For example, a men's lifestyle magazine named Brutus has recently published an issue on seasonal fashion, one on the best coffee in Tokyo and New York, one London travel guide, and one issue on trendy kitchenware and furniture. Content from one publisher covering so many different topics still keeps the same type of target audience in mind, and this target audience views the publisher as an authority, pushing a subculture forward. Minor magazine brands may release one-time issues on topics such as seasonally fashionable men's hair styles, popular seaside resorts in the Persian Gulf, and recipes from a certain region of Italy. If the American magazine industry is like a TV channel full of sitcoms, the Japanese magazine industry is like a contemporary collection of short films and documentaries, where you don't necessarily ever get a sequel to your favorite title but you can easily find another title from the same director that you'll equally enjoy.</p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">Curry is not hard to find when browsing a bookstore's selection of magazine titles. I've enocountered cooking, food, lifestyle, and fashion magazines that have published a feature or entire issue about curry. Here are the issues I've looked at in detail so far:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin: 12px 0 0px"><b>Popeye</b>, a lifestyle magazine with the tagline 'A Magazine for City Boys' and a decades-long publication history, published an issue last year called "Popeye's Tokyo Eat-Up Guide." Inside was an extensive guide to restaurants in the city. Curry is featured in the issue in a section discussing Jimbocho, a neighborhood north of the Imperial Palace with with the oldest and the highest concentration of curry restaurants in teh city. Additionally, Popeye ran a section with famous Tokyo chefs, asking them to name their favorite three dishes in the city, and curry was a favorite dish for many of them.</li>

<li style="margin: 12px 0 0"><b>Non-No</b>, a fashion magazine with both men's and women's editions, published an insert to its Summer 2015 issue that featured trendy curry and cold noodle houses in Tokyo. It is worth mentioning that Non-No has models and style icons on its staff rather than always featuring outside models or celebrities for the magazine's photographic content (this may be normal for fashion magazines in Japan). So for the special insert on curry and cold noodles, Non-No models were asked to recommend their favorite curry to eat for lunch.</li>
	
<li style="margin: 12px 0 0"><b>Dancyu</b>, a food and culture magazine, featured <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dancyu-ダンチュウ-2015年-08-月号/dp/B00ZD9EU9A" target="_blank">"Curry Life (ライフカレー)"</a> for its August 2015 issue. The issue featured a photo-rich section on Thai, Indian, and Japanese curry restaurants in Tokyo, a section on stylish plateware for serving curry, a section on cooking Indian curry at home with pre-made curry mixes and detailed recipes, a section on curry as part of the cafeteria lunch sets at Japanese grade schools, and a section on curry-flavored beverages that is featured on the cover of the issue.</li>
	
	<li style="margin: 12px 0 0"><b>The Book for The Curry Enthusiast</b> is a magazine I encountered that seems to be a one-off issue unassociated with any magazine brands. The cover mentions that it offers a guide to the newest trends in recipes and shops. This is no lie. The issue covers famous restaurants and recipes for many of the <a href="http://kare.tokyo/#curryrice" target="_blank">major Japanese curry types</a>, including a feature on regional curry variations that I've never seen in Tokyo: ramen made with a miso-curry-milk broth, curry made with raw baby sardines, sour tomato curry, skewers with pork intestine covered in curry, etc. The issue also has a major "Tokyo vs. Osaka" section, featuring the most famous curry from both cities.</li>
					</ul>
					
<p style="margin: 12px 0 0px">I bought these magazines over several trips to Tsutaya, a bookstore chain in Japan. On one visit, Tsutaya had designated a small section of the magazine area as the "curry section," with books and magazines about curry as well as dry curry mixes and other curry-related merchandise placed together. Print media's continually strong influence in Japanese culture is impressive. Anyone can practice the ritual of stopping by a bookstore to learn more about or get caught up on a topic of interest through the expansive variety of print magazines available in Japan. And judging by the crowds at the Tsutaya locations in Shibuya, Daikanyama, and Roppongi, this ritual is practiced by a major portion of the population.</p>
